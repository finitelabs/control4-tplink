## v20260711 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Forward Control4 ramp rates to the bulb as a native SMART transition, so
  brightness, color, and on/off changes fade over the programmed rate instead of
  snapping in direct mode.

### Fixed

- Restore dynamic bindings and output variables in OnDriverInit so programming
  attached to them keeps working after a Director restart.

### Changed

- Restructured the repository README as a suite overview covering both the
  TP-Link Outlet and TP-Link Light drivers, instead of embedding the outlet
  driver's documentation.

## v20260710 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Initial release.
