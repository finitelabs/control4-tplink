## Unreleased

### Added

- TP-Link Light: direct-mode support for legacy Kasa KL/LB-series bulbs (e.g.
  KL110, KL120, KL125, KL130, KL135) and light strips (KL400/KL420/KL430) via
  the IOT command schema, over the original port 9999 protocol or KLAP firmware
  with either hash generation. Devices on original firmware need no TP-Link
  credentials. Ramp rates forward as device-side transitions, matching the SMART
  path. Any Control4 light command takes over from a lighting effect running on
  a strip.
- TP-Link Light: a Protocol property (Auto/KLAP/Legacy) and a Reconnect action,
  matching the TP-Link Outlet driver. The detected transport and schema show in
  Driver Status as `Connected (SMART)`, `Connected (KLAP)`, or
  `Connected (Legacy)`.
- Verified hardware: a field install confirms the KL130 in direct mode via the
  IOT bulb schema.

### Changed

- TP-Link Light: Tapo-class devices in direct mode now show `Connected (SMART)`
  instead of `Connected (KLAP)`, matching the outlet driver's naming.

## v20260712 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- TP-Link Outlet: SMART command schema support for newer Kasa and Tapo plugs
  (e.g. EP25 hardware v2.6, KP125M, Tapo P-series), auto-detected over KLAP and
  shown as `Connected (SMART)`. TP-Link account credentials are required, and
  SMART devices on very early firmware (EP25 v2.6 firmware 1.0.2 and older) need
  a firmware update through the Kasa app.
- TP-Link Outlet: multi-outlet SMART devices (Tapo power strips, EP40M) are
  controlled through their child outlets, including per-outlet energy readings
  where the hardware reports them.
- TP-Link Outlet: KLAP v1 handshake hashing for original Kasa devices whose KLAP
  firmware uses MD5-based hashes instead of the SHA-based v2 hashes.
- TP-Link Outlet: Auto mode falls back to the legacy protocol even when the KLAP
  handshake reports an auth mismatch, so transitional Kasa firmware (seen on
  KP115 1.1.1) that answers KLAP with credentials matching no known scheme stays
  reachable over the legacy protocol it still serves on port 9999.
- Verified hardware documented from live systems: EP25 over KLAP + SMART, HS300
  on KLAP firmware, KP115 and HS110 on legacy firmware, and a Tapo L930 over
  KLAP + SMART.

## v20260711 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Forward Control4 ramp rates to the bulb as a native SMART transition, so
  brightness, color, and on/off changes fade over the programmed rate instead of
  snapping in direct mode.

### Fixed

- Restore dynamic bindings and output variables in OnDriverInit so programming
  attached to them keeps working after a Director restart.

### Changed

- Restructured the repository README as a suite overview covering both the
  TP-Link Outlet and TP-Link Light drivers, instead of embedding the outlet
  driver's documentation.

## v20260710 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Initial release.
